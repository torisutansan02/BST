# BST

I will use this repository as a reference to help me understand the binary search tree data structure. I will provide visuals to explain how my functions in my classes work. This repository will expand as solving some problems will require different test branches than the one I first created.

Many of the implementations I use consist of a constructor, polymorphism and classes. This will make it easier to understand the given functions.
